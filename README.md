## Getting Started

Update [machines.yml](machines.yml) to configure the VMs that will be created.

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh centos7-raid
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
```

## Standard Partitioning in Linux

### Partition a drive and create a file system

```bash
# list devices
ls /dev/sd*

# partition with fdisk
fdisk /dev/sdb

# list devices
ls /dev/sd*

# create a file system
# /sbin/mkfs.ext4 -L /data /dev/sdb1
```

### Mount the filesystem

```bash
# create a directory for the mounting
mkdir /data

# mount the drive to the created directory
mount /dev/sdb1 /data

# show all the current mounted systems
mount
```

### Mount the filesystem automatically

For this to happen, we need to add an entry in /etc/fstab file

```bash
vim /etc/fstab
# LABEL=/data     /data   ext4    defaults        1       2
```

### Check mounting

```bash
# list all the mounting with UUID
blkid

# list block devices
lsblk -f
```

## Logical Volumes

Volume management creates a layer of abstraction over physical storage, allowing you to create logical storage volumes.

### LVM Architecture

The underlying physical storage unit of an LVM logical volume is a block device such as a partition or whole disk. This device is initialized as an LVM physical volume (PV).

To create an LVM logical volume, the physical volumes are combined into a volume group (VG). This creates a pool of disk space out of which LVM logical volumes (LVs) can be allocated.

### LVM Components

Describes the components of an LVM Logical volume.

- Physical Volumes
  - The underlying physical storage unit of an LVM logical volume is a block device such as a partition or whole disk. To use the device for an LVM logical volume, the device must be initialized as a physical volume (PV). Initializing a block device as a physical volume places a label near the start of the device.
- Volume Groups
  - Physical volumes are combined into volume groups (VGs). This creates a pool of disk space out of which logical volumes can be allocated.
- Logical Volumes
  - In LVM, a volume group is divided up into logical volumes.
    - Linear Volumes
    - Striped Logical Volumes
    - RAID Logical Volumes
    - Thinly-Provisioned Logical Volumes (Thin Volumes)
    - Snapshot Volumes
    - Thinly-Provisioned Snapshot Volumes
    - Cache Volumes

### Install the lvm packages

```bash
yum reinstall lvm2
```

### Initializing Physical Volumes

Use the pvcreate command to initialize a block device to be used as a physical volume. Initialization is analogous to formatting a file system.

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb  /dev/sdc  /dev/sdd  /dev/sde
```

### Scanning for Block Devices

```bash
lvmdiskscan
```

### Displaying Physical Volumes

```bash
pvdisplay
pvscan
pvs
```

### Creating Volume Groups

```bash
vgcreate vg1 /dev/sdb  /dev/sdc  /dev/sdd  /dev/sde
vgdisplay vg1
vgscan
```

### RAID Logical Volumes

LVM supports RAID0/1/4/5/6/10

```bash
# 2-Way RAID1
lvcreate --type raid1 -m 1 -L 1G -n lv1 vg1

# RAID5 array (3 stripes + 1 implicit parity drive)
lvcreate --type raid5 -i 3 -L 1G -n lv2 vg1

# RAID6 array (3 stripes + 2 implicit parity drives)
lvcreate --type raid6 -i 3 -L 1G -n lv3 vg1

# 2-way RAID10 array with 3 stripes that is 10 gigabytes in size with a maximum recovery rate of 128 kiB/sec/device
lvcreate --type raid10 -i 2 -m 1 -L 9G --maxrecoveryrate 128 -n lv4 vg1

```

### Displaying Logical Volumes

There are three commands you can use to display properties of LVM logical volumes: `lvs` , `lvdisplay` , and `lvscan` .

```bash
lvs
lvdisplay -v /dev/vg1/lv4
lvscan
```

### Growing Logical Volumes

To increase the size of a logical volume, use the lvextend command.

```bash
lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg1/lv4
```

### Creating an XFS File System

```bash
mkfs.xfs /dev/vg1/lv4
```

### Mount Logical Volume

```bash
mount /dev/vg1/lv4 /mnt
df
```
